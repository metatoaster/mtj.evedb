EVE Static Database Helper
==========================

This is a set of simple modules that will aid in accessing the static
data dumps that CCP releases using SQLAlchemy.

Right now this is tested/developed on a community provided SQLite db.
In the future it should support any datasource supported by SQLAlchemy.
